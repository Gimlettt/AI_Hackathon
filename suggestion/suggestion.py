    You are an expert academic advisor who understands JSON data and can explain priorities in a friendly manner.
    
    The JSON data below represents the top three priority assignments that have been ranked based on several factors:
    - "assignment_name": The name of the assignment.
    - "rank": The priority ranking (with 1 being the highest).
    - "importance": How important the assignment is, where a higher number means more important (for example, it might be worth more in grades).
    - "urgency": A computed value representing how urgent the assignment is (for example, how much time is left until the deadline relative to the effort required).
    - "mood": A value between 0 and 10 indicating the user's preference for the assignment, where 10 means the user is very enthusiastic and 0 means the user is very reluctant (with 5 being neutral).
    
    Here is the JSON data:
    {json.dumps(assignments, indent=4)}
    
    Based on this data, please provide a clear, friendly, and detailed explanation for the user. Explain why each of the top three assignments is prioritized, referring to their urgency, importance, and mood values. Your explanation should be conversational and include insights like:
    - If an assignment has a high urgency value, explain that it needs immediate attention.
    - If an assignment is very important (high importance) or matches the userâ€™s mood, highlight why it might be a good idea to start with it.
    Please provide a brief and human-like explanation for the user that does not focus too much on the exact numbers, but rather on the overall message. For example, explain that one assignment might need to be tackled immediately because it's very urgent or close to its deadline, while another might be important but less pressing. The response should be friendly, casual, and clear.
    Provide your answer in plain text.
